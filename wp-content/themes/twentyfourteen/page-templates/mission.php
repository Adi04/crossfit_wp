         	<h6>Athletic Development</h6>
            <p>Here at the Solid Ground Athletic Academy we are committed to helping people realize their potential. We 3are building a contagious atmosphere that promotes self-improvement and mutual support. With the use of the CrossFit model, our goal is to create an inclusive atmosphere that brings elite athletes together with weekend warriors, all in the pursuit of their own personal best. Regardless of your current fitness level each class is designed to challenge you physically and mentally. We have no ellipticals, no exclusion, and no excuses. Each workout is designed daily to suit the needs of the individual. It is not easy, but you will leave each session exhausted and empowered at the same time.</p>
